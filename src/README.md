# NodeMCUGarageDoorOpener
Garage door opener for NodeMCU using MQTT.

This is WIP. The project will use a relay and reed switch to detect the garage door state, and to trigger a door toggle. Control will be through Home Assistant, using MQTT. The MCU I am using is a NodeMCU, and I'll be testing using ESP32 and ESP8266 versions.
